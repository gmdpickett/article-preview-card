## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Vanilla JS

### What I learned

I learned so much on this project! I learned that I don't know as much about Flexbox as I thought I did. I learned that patience is key to any coding project. I learned that I am still learning and need to remind myself of that. 

Now for the non-existential bullshit type stuff. 

I learned about the differences between using only a single event trigger and dual event triggers, ``mouseover`` and ``mouseout``, to try and make a button work. When using only ``mouseover`` in the ``addEventListener`` it was so glitchy. 

I also learned that ``event.stopPropogation`` is important when working with functions that access the same elements on a page. 

Probably the most humbling lesson was forgeting to select the button on the design before trying to get the JavaScript all done. I couldn't figure out why anywhere I clicked on the page the share flyout was appearing, I was selecting the whole page rather than just the button. 

### Continued development

Just more work, I can see small connections being made between what I've been learning and what I'm able to do, sometimes without even needing to reference the MDN or StackOverflow! While it's been a fun week of putting my lessons into practice, I still have so much to learn. I am going to be trying to work through 3 projects a week until I'm done with all Newbie projects and then go down to 1, maybe 2, in the Junior challenges on Frontend Mentor.
